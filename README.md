<h1>Tesla CRUD App</h1>

**This is a CRUD application I made a few years ago. It uses PHP on the backend and a MySQL database to store the data. The user can register/login and then CRUD data rendered to the main page.<br /><br /> To use the app run clone this repo using git clone https://github.com/HarryH-Tech/Tesla_CRUD. Then import the favorites.sql table into a MySQL database called "tesla_registration" in phpMyAdmin.<br /><br />You'll then have to create a pdo.php file in the favorites directory and fil it in using the same configuration as below except replacing the host, port number, username and password to suit your MySQL configuration. ![PDO Configuration](./PDOExample.PNG)<br /><br />You can then navigate to http://localhost/Tesla_CRUD/index.php to view the website.**
